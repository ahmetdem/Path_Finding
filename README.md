# A* Pathfinding Algorithm in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the A* algorithm for pathfinding. The A* algorithm is a popular search algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph or grid.

## Features

- A* algorithm implementation in Python.
- Support for grid-based pathfinding problems.
- Customizable heuristic function for estimating the cost.
- Returns the shortest path from a start node to a goal node.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmetdem/path_finding.git
